# Mountain cabin resort Website in Romania - Bootstrap 5

# Simple one page website for a Mountain resort in Romania

## notes:

.put all components in a {container} as they are responsive.

.add a parent div with class f {{d-flex}} and then add the children inside to arrange them as {{flexbox}}

.img: images are always going to over flow
add the class => {img-fluid} and eg: {w-50} to reduce the size of the image.

---

## breakpoints: if i add the ((SM)) breakpoint to the flex eg {{d-sm-flex}} this means that as soon as the width is more than the small screen it will switch to flex,

## this means small screens it will not be flex but once the breakpoint for the width is more than sm then it will be d-flex
